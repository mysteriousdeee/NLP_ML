I found this help well explained course on LinkedIn with follow along

## Descrption

### Dataset 
`SMSSpamCollection.tsv` is a tsv file that is delimited by "\t"

### Enttry point
`data_cleaning.ipynb` is the jupyter notebook file for the build and practice of NLP, find a suitable

## Preparing the dataset

### Procedure for cleaning data
1.  Import libraries {pandas, re, string, nltk}.
2.  Read the data into dataframe.
3.  View the raw dataset to determine what next.
4.  Start organising the dataset into rows, using re.
5.  Check for missing data "understand isnull and findall"
6.  Remove, special char, tokenise data, drop stopwords
7.  Perform stemming, perform lemmatising, study the difference.

### Change those text to some binaries
This particular task was carried out in the file `vectorisation.ipynb` as we tokenised here in
a more pythonic way

#### Procedure for vectoriation
#### Count vectorisation
